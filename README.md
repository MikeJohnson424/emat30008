This repository contains a collection of functions to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and find limit cycles for given systems. The code provides various numerical integration methods, including the forward Euler method and the Runge-Kutta 4 method. Additionally, it includes functionality for finding the initial conditions and period of limit cycles using the shooting method.

This repository contains code for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using various numerical integration methods, as well as finding limit cycles for given ODE systems.
